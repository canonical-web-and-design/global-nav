# Canonical Global Nav

This project contains the JavaScript and styles to display a banner across the top of a page.

This banner displays a list of Canonical eco-system websites giving a user the ability to jump around the core sites easily.

## Usage

Use a node package manager to install this component and then link the JS file into the head of your site, with optional settings.

The styles will automatically be injected into the page's `<head>`.

1. Install via yarn or npm

```bash
yarn add @canonical/global-nav

```

...or...

```bash
npm install @canonical/global-nav --save
```

2. You can then install the library either by directly linking to it or via ES6 imports.

To consume the library directly, add a link to the JS file containing an [IIFE](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE) and run the `canonicalGlobalNav.createNav()` function;

```html
<script src="/node_modules/@canonical/global-nav/dist/iife.js"></script>
<script>
  canonicalGlobalNav.createNav();
</script>
```

To import it, simply call it from your site-wide JS file;

```js
import { createNav } from '@canonical/global-nav';
createNav();
```

### Options

The `createNav` function takes an object of options with the following properties:

- `maxWidth`: The [max-width](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/max-width) of the global nav element (default: `68rem`)
- `showLogins`: Should the "logins" drop-down be shown? (default: `false`)

For example, to use the global-nav without the "login" section, and set the `max-width` to `80rem`:

```html
<script src="/node_modules/@canonical/global-nav/dist/index.js"></script>

<script>
  canonicalGlobalNav.createNav({ showLogins: false, maxWidth: '80rem' });
</script>
```

If you're importing;

```js
import { createNav } from '@canonical/global-nav';
createNav({ showLogins: false, maxWidth: '80rem' });
```

## Building the Global nav

To build the JS into the `/dist` folder, run:

```
yarn install
yarn build
```

You can view the build files in action by opening the `index.html` in the root of this project.

## Contributing

When developing this project you can run the following command to listen to changes in the `src/js/*.js` and `src/sass/*.scss` files and build them into the `/dist` folder.

```
yarn watch
```

Before submitting your pull request, run the linters - which checks both the JS and Sass for errors.

```
yarn lint
```

### How to add inline svgs

Just because this was a bit of a pain, here is what I did.

1. [Shrink the svg](https://www.svgminify.com/) as much as possible
2. Upload it to the asset server for others - OPTIONAL
3. View it in a browser and grab the source code.
4. Convert the quotes from double `"` to single `'` - CRITICAL
5. [Encode the svg](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/dencoder/)
6. Add this with `data:image/svg+xml,` in the right place in product-details.js

### Release process

The package is versioned using [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) and published to the NPM registry.

To cut a new release run;

```bash
npm version [patch|minor|major]
```

This will trigger the `prepublishonly` script which will ensure requisite artefacts are built before publishing.
